## Part 2: Reflection
Overall, I learned a lot of key details and techniques about software in this course, especially with the help of labs. Something in particular I learned from my lab experience was vim! I had no clue what vim was before being introuced to it in this course, and the lab specifically helped me navigate through vim, understand it in both normal and insert mode, and save and quitâ€“can't forget about that...
