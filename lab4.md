# Doing it All From the Command Line
## These steps involve editing, compiling, and running commands from the terminal!
### 1. Log into ieng6
Begin by logging into your ieng6 account by entering ```ssh cs15lsp23[!!]@ieng6.ucsd.edu``` into the terminal for ```bash```. Subsitute the ```!!``` for the letters you recieved for your own ieng6 account. After entering, ```Password:``` should come up which in turn will permit the user (or you) to enter their/your password. It should look like something similar to the image below.
