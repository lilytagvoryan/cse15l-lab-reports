Begin by logging into your ieng6 account by entering ```ssh cs15lsp23[!!]@ieng6.ucsd.edu``` into the terminal for ```bash```. Subsitute the ```!!``` for the letters you recieved for your own ieng6 account. After entering, ```Password:``` should come up which in turn will permit the user (or you) to enter their/your password.
